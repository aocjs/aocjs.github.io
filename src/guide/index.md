# Introduction

Starting with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems could be really tedious. That's why helpful tools come up trying to standarize file structure and remove _copying text files_ step.

With this goals has borned [@aocjs/cli](https://github.com/aocjs/cli) for **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**. You could check all it's features [below](#features).

To group all _AoC_ releated repos **aocjs** has been created.
